# Project Name
> Linear Regression Model for Bike Sharing system



## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
 they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

  Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Conclusions
- The model is built and evaluated with the test data set. The equation for the target variable is formed. The model has a R-square value of 0.775 that implie sthat 77.5% variance can be explained with this model.
